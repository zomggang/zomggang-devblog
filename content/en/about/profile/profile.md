## 🧑‍💻 Zomggang's Engineering Blog / 開発勉強ブログ

Welcome to Zomggang's engineering blog!  
This is a technical blog where I document what I learn through hands-on development.

Content is available in **Korean**, **Japanese**, and **English**, and covers practical topics such as **Java**, **Spring**, **React**, **AWS**, **CI/CD**, and **productivity hacks** relevant to real-world development.

Built with **Hugo** and deployed via **GitHub Pages**, this blog is designed with multilingual support to reach a diverse audience of developers and tech enthusiasts.
